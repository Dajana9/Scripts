## A repo for Python scripts :)

### 1. Searching for a document containing some terms, but forgot the document name?

Maybe this can help! (search_for_words.py)   
Enter the path to the directory from which you want to start search.  
Enter the words you are looking for.  
The program will enter all subdirectories in the search...
